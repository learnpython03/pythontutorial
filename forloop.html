    <h1>Python for Loop Statements</h1>


<p>It has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
for iterating_var in sequence:
   statements(s)
</pre>
<p>If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in the sequence is assigned to the iterating variable <i>iterating_var</i>. Next, the statements block is executed. Each item in the list is assigned to <i>iterating_var</i>, and the statement(s) block is executed until the entire sequence is exhausted.</p>
<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/python_for_loop.jpg" alt="for loop in Python" />
<h3>Example</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

for letter in <b>'Python':</b>     # First Example
   print 'Current Letter :', letter

fruits = ['banana', 'apple',  'mango']
for fruit in <b>fruits</b>:        # Second Example
   print 'Current fruit :', fruit

print "Good bye!"
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Current Letter : P
Current Letter : y
Current Letter : t
Current Letter : h
Current Letter : o
Current Letter : n
Current fruit : banana
Current fruit : apple
Current fruit : mango
Good bye!
</pre>
<h2>Iterating by Sequence Index</h2>
<p>An alternative way of iterating through each item is by index offset into the sequence itself. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">


fruits = ['banana', 'apple',  'mango']
for index in range(len(fruits)):
   print 'Current fruit :', fruits[index]

print "Good bye!"
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Current fruit : banana
Current fruit : apple
Current fruit : mango
Good bye!
</pre>
<p>Here, we took the assistance of the len() built-in function, which provides the total number of elements in the tuple as well as the range() built-in function to give us the actual sequence to iterate over.</p>
<h2>Using else Statement with For Loop</h2>
<p>Python supports to have an else statement associated with a loop statement</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If the <b>else</b> statement is used with a <b>for</b> loop, the <b>else</b> statement is executed when the loop has exhausted iterating the list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following example illustrates the combination of an else statement with a for statement that searches for prime numbers from 10 through 20.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">


for num in range(10,20):     #to iterate between 10 to 20
   for i in range(2,num):    #to iterate on the factors of the number
      if num%i == 0:         #to determine the first factor
         j=num/i             #to calculate the second factor
         print '%d equals %d * %d' % (num,i,j)
         break #to move to the next number, the #first FOR
   else:                  # else part of the loop
      print num, 'is a prime number'
		break
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
10 equals 2 * 5
11 is a prime number
12 equals 2 * 6
13 is a prime number
14 equals 2 * 7
15 equals 3 * 5
16 equals 2 * 8
17 is a prime number
18 equals 2 * 9
19 is a prime number
