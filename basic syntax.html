    <h1>Python - Basic Syntax</h1>




<p>The Python syntax defines a set of rules that are used to create Python statements while writing a Python Program. The Python Programming Language Syntax has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java Programming Languages. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.</p>

<h2>First Python Program</h2>
<p>Let us execute a Python "Hello, World!" Programs in different modes of programming.</p>

<h3>Python - Interactive Mode Programming</h3>
<p>We can invoke a Python interpreter from command line by typing <b>python</b> at the command prompt as following &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$ python
Python 3.6.8 (default, Sep 10 2021, 09:13:53)
[GCC 8.5.0 20210514 (Red Hat 8.5.0-3)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> denotes a Python Command Prompt where you can type your commands. Let's type the following text at the Python prompt and press the Enter &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ("Hello, World!")
</pre>
<p>If you are running older version of Python, like Python 2.4.x, then you would need to use print statement without parenthesis as in <b>print "Hello, World!"</b>. However in Python version 3.x, this produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello, World!
</pre>
<h3>Python - Script Mode Programming</h3>
<p>We can invoke the Python interpreter with a script parameter which begins the execution of the script and continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no longer active.</p>
<p>Let us write a simple Python program in a script which is simple text file. Python files have extension <b>.py</b>. Type the following source code in a <b>test.py</b> file &minus;</p>
<pre class="demo-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
print ("Hello, World!")
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$ python test.py
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello, World!
</pre>
<p>Let us try another way to execute a Python script. Here is the modified test.py file &minus;</p>
<pre class="demo-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">


print ("Hello, World!")
</pre>
<p>We assume that you have Python interpreter available in /usr/bin directory. Now, try to run this program as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello, World!
</pre>
<h2>Python Identifiers</h2>
<p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).</p>
<p>Python does not allow punctuation characters such as &commat;, $, and % within identifiers.</p>
<blockquote>Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, <b>Manpower</b> and <b>manpower</b> are two different identifiers in Python.</blockquote>

<p>Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Python Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is <b>private</b> identifier.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly <b>private</b> identifier.</p></li>
<li><p>If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a <b>language-defined</b> special name.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Python Reserved Words</h2>
<p>The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot use them as constant or variable or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<td>and</td>
<td>as</td>
<td>assert</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>break</td>
<td>class</td>
<td>continue</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>def</td>
<td>del</td>
<td>elif</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>else</td>
<td>except</td>
<td>False</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>finally</td>
<td>for</td>
<td>from</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>global</td>
<td>if</td>
<td>import</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>in</td>
<td>is</td>
<td>lambda</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>None</td>
<td>nonlocal</td>
<td>not</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>or</td>
<td>pass</td>
<td>raise </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>return</td>
<td>True</td>
<td>try</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>while</td>
<td>with</td>
<td>yield</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Python Lines and Indentation</h2>
<p>Python programming provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by <b>line indentation</b>, which is rigidly enforced.</p>
<p>The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="just-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
if True:
   print ("True")
else:
   print ("False")
</pre>
<p>However, the following block generates an error &minus;</p>
<pre class="demo-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
if True:
print ("Answer")
print ("True")
else:
print ("Answer")
print ("False")
</pre>
<p>Thus, in Python all the continuous lines indented with same number of spaces would form a block.</p>

<h2>Python Multi-Line Statements</h2>
<p>Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="just-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
total = item_one + \
        item_two + \
        item_three
</pre>
<p>Statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation character. For example following statement works well in Python &minus;</p>
<pre class="just-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
        'Thursday', 'Friday']
</pre>
<h2>Quotations in Python</h2>
<p>Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.</p>
<p>The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal &minus;</p>
<pre class="just-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
word = 'word'

sentence = "This is a sentence."

paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
 made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
</pre>
<h2>Comments in Python</h2>
<p>A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the Python source code. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are ignored by Python interpreter</p>
<p>Just like most modern languages, Python supports single-line (or end-of-line) and multi-line (block) comments. Python comments are very much similar to the comments available in PHP, BASH and Perl Programming languages.</p>

<p>A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.</p>

<pre class="demo-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
# First comment
print ("Hello, World!") # Second comment
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello, World!
</pre>
<p>You can type a comment on the same line after a statement or expression &minus;</p>
<pre class="just-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
name = "Madisetti" # This is again comment
</pre>
<p>You can comment multiple lines as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="just-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
# This is a comment.
# This is a comment, too.
# This is a comment, too.
# I said that already.
</pre>
<p>Following triple-quoted string is also ignored by Python interpreter and can be used as a multiline comments:</p>
<pre class="just-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
'''
This is a multiline
comment.
'''
</pre>
<h2>Using Blank Lines in Python Programs</h2>
<p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line and Python totally ignores it.</p>
<p>In an interactive interpreter session, you must enter an empty physical line to terminate a multiline statement.</p>

<h2>Multiple Statements on a Single Line</h2>
<p>The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line given that neither statement starts a new code block. Here is a sample snip using the semicolon &minus;</p>
<pre class="demo-code notranslate language-python" data-lang="python3">
import sys; x = 'foo'; sys.stdout.write(x + '\n')
</pre>



<form action="compiler.html">
        
    <button class="button-29" role="button-29">COMPILER</button>
    </form>










</body>
